# ChallegeGianReto2022

This is the git for code used and developped for Gian Reto's Challenge in the HackaHealth Hackathon 2022, Zurich.

## Description

In this project, the goal is to develop a concept how announcements on trains can be made accessible for people with hearing loss. 
When Gian Reto travels with public transportation, he often misses crucial information regarding the next stop, connecting trains, 
or chages in the schedule that are only communcated trough speakers. He is therefore looking for a way 
how this information can be presented to him such that he knows if the platform of a connecting train has changed next time he travelles. 
This challenge will be supported by SBB
